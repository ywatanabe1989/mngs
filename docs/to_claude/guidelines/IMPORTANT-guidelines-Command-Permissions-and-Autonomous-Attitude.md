## Command Permissions
Please see:
Global Permissions: `~/.claude.json`
Project-specific Permissions: `PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/settings.json`

## Work Aggressively
As long as commands are allowed, proceed with your decision making. No confirmation is needed unless your actions might cause significant destructive effects.

## Buzzer as a Safeguard
When you need my agreement, please let me know. To make this clear, use `./docs/tools/wsl2-buzzer.sh` to send an audible notification to me.

## Your Understanding Check
Did you understand the guideline? If yes, please say:
`CLAUDE UNDERSTOOD: <THIS FILE PATH HERE>`
