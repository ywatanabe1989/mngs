# Fixing Category and Distribution Plots

This document explains the fixes applied to address issues with the parameter category and distribution plots in the visualization script.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Parameter Categories CSV Export**
   - The parameter_categories.csv file was empty (1 byte)
   - The bar plot was not tracking data correctly

2. **Parameter Distributions Plot**
   - The x and y labels/ticks for categorical plots were not properly configured
   - Frequency ranges in the plots were not displaying clear values

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Data Tracking to Category Bar Plot

```python
# Before:
bars = ax.bar(categories, category_counts, color=colors)

# After:
bars = ax.bar(categories, category_counts, color=colors, id="parameter_categories")
```

### 2. Added IDs to Distribution Bar Plots

```python
# Before:
ax.barh(range(len(sorted_mem)), sorted_mem)

# After:
ax.barh(range(len(sorted_mem)), sorted_mem, id="memory_impact")
```

### 3. Improved Frequency Range Display

```python
# Before:
ax.axhspan(low, high, alpha=0.3, label=f"Phase Band {i+1}")

# After:
ax.axhspan(low, high, alpha=0.3, label=f"Phase Band {i+1} ({low}-{high} Hz)")
```

## Benefits

1. **Better CSV Export**: All plots now properly export their data to CSV
2. **Clearer Visualization**: Frequency range plots now show exact values in the legend
3. **Consistent Tracking**: All plots use a consistent ID naming scheme

## Usage

Run the fix script to apply these improvements:

```bash
python fix_category_and_distribution_plots.py /path/to/gPAC-paper-with-code/scripts/1_data_preparation/visualize_parameter_space.py
```

After applying the fix, running the visualization script should produce:
- A proper parameter_categories.csv file with actual data
- Improved parameter_distributions.png with better labels and frequency ranges

## Technical Details

The fixes leverage our enhanced tracking system to:
1. Assign meaningful IDs to all plots
2. Ensure proper data capture for CSV export
3. Improve the visual presentation of frequency ranges

These changes maintain full compatibility with the existing visualization workflow while addressing the specific issues with the category and distribution plots.
