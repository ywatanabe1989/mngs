# CLAUDE_PLAN - MNGS Project Improvement Progress

## Project Overview
Working on feature branch: `feature/improve-mngs-organization-20250529-231954`
Goal: Transform MNGS into a reliable go-to tool for scientific Python projects

## Current Status (2025-05-29)
- Created feature branch for organized development
- USER_PLAN.md established with 5 milestones
- Starting Milestone 1: Code Organization and Cleanliness

## Milestone Progress

### Milestone 1: Code Organization and Cleanliness
**Status**: In Progress
- [ ] Audit current directory structure
- [ ] Identify and remove duplicate code
- [ ] Consolidate similar functionalities
- [ ] Create module organization diagram
- [ ] Clean up file naming (remove versioning suffixes)

### Milestone 2: Naming and Documentation Standards
**Status**: Not Started
- [ ] Define naming convention guidelines
- [ ] Create docstring template
- [ ] Update all function/class names
- [ ] Add docstrings to all public APIs
- [ ] Configure Sphinx
- [ ] Generate initial documentation

### Milestone 3: Test Coverage Enhancement
**Status**: Not Started
- [ ] Run coverage report
- [ ] Identify untested modules
- [ ] Write unit tests for core modules
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Milestone 4: Examples and Use Cases
**Status**: Not Started
- [ ] Create examples directory structure
- [ ] Write basic usage examples for each module
- [ ] Create scientific workflow examples
- [ ] Develop data analysis tutorials
- [ ] Write visualization examples
- [ ] Create README for examples

### Milestone 5: Module Independence
**Status**: Not Started
- [ ] Create dependency graph
- [ ] Identify circular dependencies
- [ ] Refactor tightly coupled modules
- [ ] Define clear module APIs
- [ ] Document module interfaces
- [ ] Create architecture documentation

## Key Decisions Made
1. Using feature branch workflow for development
2. Following test-driven development where applicable
3. Prioritizing code organization before documentation
4. Maintaining backward compatibility during refactoring

## Next Steps
1. Complete directory structure audit
2. Identify files with version suffixes for cleanup
3. Run test coverage analysis to establish baseline
4. Create module dependency visualization

## Notes
- All changes tracked in git with meaningful commits
- Following MNGS coding standards throughout
- Using safe_rm.sh for any file removals
- Documenting all major decisions in this file
