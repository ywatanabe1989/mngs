# Next Steps for MNGS Project - Handoff Document

**Date**: 2025-05-30 18:20
**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**Purpose**: Clear handoff to next agent/session

## Current Project State

### What Was Accomplished Today

1. **Documentation Victory** ðŸ“š
   - Generated complete API documentation (49 files)
   - Sphinx builds successfully with all modules indexed

2. **Test Suite Improvements** ðŸ§ª
   - Gen tests: 14/14 passing (100%)
   - IO tests: 16/22 passing (73%) - improved from 10/22
   - PLT tests: 18/18 passing (100%)

3. **Critical Fixes** ðŸ”§
   - Fixed stdout/stderr handling bug
   - Fixed NPZ loader (preserves dict interface)
   - Text loader returns full content
   - Added Excel support
   - Enhanced HDF5 handling
   - Added glob pattern support
   - Added compressed file support

### Remaining IO Test Failures (6)
1. Complex DataFrame with categorical dtype
2. Special characters in file paths
3. Format inference from content
4. Glob function calls (implementation issue)

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Complete IO Test Fixes (1-2 hours)
The remaining 6 failures are close to resolution:
- DataFrame category dtype: Update test expectations or handle in save/load
- Special characters: May need path sanitization
- Format inference: Implementation vs test mismatch
- Glob issues: Simple fix for function vs module confusion

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Tests for Core Modules (4-6 hours)
Following the successful pattern from gen/io/plt:
- **dsp module**: Signal processing tests
- **stats module**: Statistical function tests  
- **pd module**: Pandas utility tests

### 3. Update Documentation (2 hours)
- Add examples to API docs
- Create getting started tutorial
- Document actual vs expected behavior for IO module

### 4. Feature Requests (as time permits)
- Review `/project_management/feature_requests/`
- Prioritize based on user needs

## Quick Start for Next Agent

```bash
# 1. Check current test status
cd /data/gpfs/projects/punim2354/ywatanabe/.claude-worktree/mngs_repo
python -m pytest tests/mngs/io/test__io_comprehensive.py -v

# 2. Read the bulletin board
cat project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md

# 3. Continue with highest priority task
# Either: Fix remaining IO tests
# Or: Start dsp comprehensive tests
```

## Key Files to Review
1. `/project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md` - Latest status
2. `/project_management/feature_requests/feature-request-project-advancement-roadmap.md` - Overall progress
3. `/tests/mngs/gen/test__start_comprehensive.py` - Good test pattern example

## Project Metrics
- Phase 1 (Foundation): 35%
- Phase 2 (Quality): 15%
- Phase 3 (Usability): 75%
- Phase 4 (Enhancement): 10%
- Phase 5 (Infrastructure): 0%

## Final Notes
- Excellent collaborative progress today
- Test suite significantly more reliable
- Clear path to 80% coverage goal
- Project gaining momentum

Good luck to the next agent! The foundation is solid - keep building! ðŸš€
