Task: Fixing mngs.io comprehensive test failures

## Summary
Significant progress made on fixing io module test failures. Reduced failing tests from 11 to 6.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Text Loader Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Text loader was returning list of lines instead of original text
- **Solution**: Modified `_load_txt` to return full content by default
- **Impact**: test_text_roundtrip now passes

### 2. Excel Support Implementation ✅
- **Issue**: Excel (.xlsx) format not supported in save function
- **Solution**: Added Excel support in `_save.py` using pandas.DataFrame.to_excel()
- **Impact**: test_excel_roundtrip now passes

### 3. HDF5 Support Enhancement ✅
- **Issue**: HDF5 save/load didn't handle nested dicts and had type conversion issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented recursive save/load for nested structures
  - Added type conversions (bytes→string, numpy→python types)
  - Added .h5 extension support
- **Impact**: test_hdf5_roundtrip now passes

### 4. Glob Pattern Support ✅
- **Issue**: Load function didn't support glob patterns for batch file loading
- **Solution**: Added glob pattern detection and batch loading in load function
- **Impact**: test_load_with_glob_pattern now passes

### 5. Compressed Files Support ✅
- **Issue**: .pkl.gz files couldn't be loaded
- **Solution**: Updated pickle loader to handle gzip compression
- **Impact**: test_load_compressed_files now passes

## Test Results

Before: 11 failed, 11 passed
After: 6 failed, 16 passed

## Remaining Issues

1. **NPZ Compression** - save function expects dict/list for .npz but test passes single array
2. **DataFrame Category Dtype** - Category dtype not preserved in Excel roundtrip
3. **Path Cleaning** - Special characters in paths are being cleaned/modified
4. **Format Inference** - yaml.load requires Loader argument
5. **Glob Functions** - Tests expect mngs.io.glob function that doesn't exist

## Recommendations

1. Implement mngs.io.glob function or update tests to use load with glob pattern
2. Fix NPZ save to handle single arrays
3. Review path cleaning logic for special characters
4. Update yaml loader call to include Loader parameter
5. Consider preserving DataFrame dtypes in Excel save/load

## Code Changes

- `/src/mngs/io/_load_modules/_txt.py` - Modified to return full text
- `/src/mngs/io/_save.py` - Added Excel and improved HDF5 support
- `/src/mngs/io/_load_modules/_hdf5.py` - Added recursive loading and type conversions
- `/src/mngs/io/_load.py` - Added glob pattern support and .h5 extension
- `/src/mngs/io/_load_modules/_pickle.py` - Added .pkl.gz support

## Next Steps

The remaining 6 test failures are mostly minor issues that can be resolved quickly. The io module is close to achieving full test coverage for the comprehensive test suite.
