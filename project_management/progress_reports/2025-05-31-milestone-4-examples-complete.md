This milestone significantly enhances the usability of the MNGS framework by providing practical, runnable examples that demonstrate best practices and real-world applications.

## Achievements

### 1. Examples Created for All Modules

All 10 major MNGS modules now have comprehensive examples:

- **io**: `basic_file_operations.py` - File I/O operations
- **gen**: `experiment_workflow.py` - Environment setup and reproducibility
- **plt**: `enhanced_plotting.py` - Advanced plotting with data tracking
- **pd**: `dataframe_operations.py` - Pandas utilities
- **dsp**: `signal_processing.py` - Digital signal processing
- **stats**: `statistical_analysis.py` - Statistical workflows
- **ai**: `machine_learning_workflow.py` - ML pipelines
- **nn**: `neural_network_layers.py` - Custom PyTorch layers (NEW)
- **db**: `database_operations.py` - Database operations (NEW)
- **workflows**: `scientific_data_pipeline.py` - Complete integration

### 2. Neural Network Examples (nn module)

Created comprehensive demonstration of MNGS neural network layers:
- Signal processing layers (Filters, Hilbert, PSD, Wavelet)
- Data augmentation layers (channel/frequency gain changes)
- Analysis layers (PAC, ModulationIndex)
- Complete PyTorch model integration
- Visualization of layer outputs

### 3. Database Examples (db module)

Created extensive database operations examples:
- SQLite database creation and management
- Table operations with foreign keys
- CRUD operations
- Efficient batch operations
- NumPy array storage as BLOBs
- Transaction management
- CSV import/export
- Database maintenance and optimization

### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated `examples/README.md` with:
  - Descriptions for all 10 example modules
  - Running instructions
  - Output structure explanations
  - Tips for using examples
  - Integration guidance

## Milestone 4 Tasks Completion

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Create examples directory structure | ✅ Complete |
| Write basic usage examples for each module | ✅ Complete (10+ files) |
| Create scientific workflow examples | ✅ Complete |
| Develop data analysis tutorials | ✅ Complete |
| Write visualization examples | ✅ Complete |
| Create README for examples | ✅ Complete |

## Impact

1. **User Onboarding**: New users can now quickly understand MNGS capabilities
2. **Best Practices**: Examples demonstrate proper usage patterns
3. **Real-World Applications**: Scientific workflow examples show practical integration
4. **Self-Contained**: All examples are runnable without external dependencies
5. **Learning Resources**: Examples serve as templates for user projects

## Next Steps

With Milestone 4 complete, the project can move forward with:
1. Creating Jupyter notebook tutorials (optional enhancement)
2. Continuing AI module refactoring (Phase 3 - Testing)
3. Working on remaining milestones

## Files Created/Modified

- `/examples/mngs/nn/neural_network_layers.py` (NEW)
- `/examples/mngs/db/database_operations.py` (NEW)
- `/examples/README.md` (UPDATED)
- `/project_management/BULLETIN-BOARD.md` (UPDATED)
- `/project_management/USER_PLAN.md` (UPDATED)

## Conclusion

Milestone 4 is now 100% complete. All MNGS modules have comprehensive, well-documented examples that demonstrate their capabilities and best practices. This significantly improves the framework's usability and provides users with practical templates for their own scientific computing projects.

The examples showcase MNGS's strength as a unified framework for scientific Python development, with modules that work seamlessly together while maintaining independence.
