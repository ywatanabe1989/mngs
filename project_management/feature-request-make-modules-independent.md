# Feature Request: Make Modules Independent

**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High
**Requested by:** ywatanabe

## Description

This feature request aims to improve the modularity of the MNGS codebase by making modules more independent from each other. Currently, there may be too many interdependencies between modules, which can make the codebase harder to maintain, test, and extend.

## Motivation

- Improve code maintainability by reducing coupling between modules
- Enable easier testing of individual components
- Allow for selective importing of only needed functionality
- Reduce potential for circular imports
- Improve overall code quality and architecture

## Requirements

1. Analyze current module dependencies throughout the codebase
2. Identify modules with high interdependence
3. Refactor code to reduce unnecessary dependencies
4. Ensure proper use of interfaces between modules
5. Update import statements to reflect new structure
6. Add appropriate test coverage for refactored modules
7. Document any API changes resulting from the refactoring

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Conduct dependency analysis of the codebase
- Create visual representation of module dependencies
- Identify high-priority modules to refactor
- Document current pain points and architectural issues

### Phase 2: Design
- Design improved module interfaces
- Create plan for breaking circular dependencies
- Define clear boundaries between modules
- Establish testing strategy for refactored components

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Refactor high-priority modules first
- Update import statements throughout codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Add/update tests for all refactored modules

### Phase 4: Validation
- Ensure all tests pass with refactored modules
- Verify performance is maintained or improved
- Document any API changes for users
- Update examples to reflect new module structure

## Success Criteria

- No circular imports in the codebase
- Reduced module interdependencies (measurable via static analysis)
- All tests passing
- No regression in functionality
- Improved developer experience when importing specific functionality

## Resources Required

- Developer time for analysis, refactoring, and testing
- Code review resources
- CI/CD pipeline to verify changes

## Notes

This refactoring should follow the project's test-driven workflow guidelines, with tests being written/updated before implementation changes are made.
