## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Automatic Output Management**: All examples save outputs to organized directories
2. **Data Tracking**: Plots automatically export their data as CSV files
3. **Reproducibility**: Examples show how to set random seeds and track experiments
4. **Error Handling**: Examples include proper try-finally blocks where appropriate
5. **Documentation**: Each example is thoroughly commented

## Output Structure

After running the examples, you'll find outputs organized as:

```
output/
├── arrays/           # NumPy arrays and compressed data
├── dataframes/       # CSV files from pandas DataFrames
├── configs/          # JSON and YAML configuration files
├── reports/          # Text and markdown reports
├── plots/            # PNG images AND their corresponding CSV data

```

## Tips for Using Examples

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `basic_file_operations.py` to understand core concepts
2. **Check Outputs**: Always examine the generated files to understand what mngs creates
3. **Read Comments**: Examples include detailed comments explaining each step
4. **Modify and Experiment**: Feel free to modify examples for your needs
5. **Use as Templates**: These examples can serve as templates for your own scripts

## Integration with Your Projects

To use these patterns in your own work:

```python
# Minimal usage
import mngs
data = mngs.io.load("your_data.csv")
mngs.io.save(results, "output.json")

# Full workflow
import sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mngs

CONFIG, sys.stdout, sys.stderr, plt, CC = mngs.gen.start(sys, plt)
# Your experiment code here
mngs.gen.close(CONFIG)
```

## Next Steps

After exploring these examples:
1. Read the full documentation in `docs/mngs_guidelines/`
2. Check out the module-specific guides
3. Explore the test files for more usage patterns
