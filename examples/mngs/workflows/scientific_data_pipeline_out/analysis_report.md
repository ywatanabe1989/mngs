# Scientific Data Pipeline Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the analysis of multi-channel physiological signals.

## Data Summary
- **Number of subjects**: 5
- **Number of channels**: 4
- **Sampling frequency**: 1000 Hz
- **Signal duration**: 10 seconds

## Feature Extraction
Extracted features include:
- Power spectral density in standard frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- Statistical measures (mean, std, skewness)
