Among 317 patients, 96.2% experienced seizure recurrence, with the majority (68.8%) occurring within the first 6-month follow-up period. Notable risk factors for recurrence included focal seizures, symptomatic seizure causes, abnormal initial electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging results, and the presence of neurological disorders. Interestingly, the type of epileptiform activity in the initial EEG did not predict recurrence risk. Over a 3-year period, the overall recurrence risk was 98.4%, particularly higher in cases with symptomatic seizures compared to idiopathic (genetic) ones. These findings underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring, particularly in the early post-seizure follow-up period, and advocate for initial EEG assessments, especially in cases of remote symptomatic first unprovoked seizures.}

The increasing availability of large-scale datasets detailing brain circuit composition, connectivity, and activity is transforming neuroscience. However, integrating and interpreting this data remains challenging. Concurrently, advances in supercomputing and sophisticated modeling tools now enable the development of highly detailed, large-scale biophysical circuit models. These mechanistic multiscale models offer a method to systematically integrate experimental data, facilitating investigations into brain structure, function, and disease. This review, based on a Society for Neuroscience 2024 MiniSymposium, aims to disseminate recent advances in large-scale mechanistic modeling to the broader community. It highlights (1) examples of current models for various brain regions developed through experimental data integration; (2) their predictive capabilities regarding cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying experimental recordings (e.g., membrane voltage, spikes, local-field potential, electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) and brain function; and (3) their use in simulating biomarkers for brain diseases like epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's, aiding in understanding their biophysical underpinnings and developing novel treatments. The review showcases state-of-the-art models covering hippocampus, somatosensory, visual, motor, auditory cortical, and thalamic circuits across species. These models predict neural activity at multiple scales and provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying sensation, motor behavior, brain signals, neural coding, disease, pharmacological interventions, and neural stimulation. Collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and clinicians is essential for the development and validation of these models, particularly as datasets grow. Hence, this review aims to foster interest in detailed brain circuit models, leading to cross-disciplinary collaborations that accelerate brain research.}

We fitted a three-layer neural mass model of a cortical column to intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from a Tetanus Toxin rat model of epilepsy, which also included responses to periodic electrical stimulation. Our results show that some of the connectivity weights between different neural populations correlate significantly with the number of seizures each day, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of neural circuits during epileptogenesis. We also simulated single-pulse electrical stimulation of the neuronal populations to observe their responses after the connectivity weights were optimized to fit background (non-seizure) EEG data. The recovery time, defined as the time from stimulation until the membrane potential returns to baseline, was measured as a representation of the critical slowing down phenomenon observed in nonlinear systems operating near a bifurcation boundary. The results revealed that recovery times in the responses of the computational model fitted to the EEG data were longer during 5 min periods preceding seizures compared to 1 hr before seizures in four out of six rats. Analysis of the iEEG recorded in response to electrical stimulation revealed results similar to the computational model in four out of six rats. This study supports the potential use of this computational model as a model-based biomarker for seizure prediction when direct electrical stimulation to the brain is not feasible.}

Here we utilize the general framework of explosive synchronization (ES) from complex systems science to study the role of network structure and resource dynamics in the generation and propagation of seizures. We show that a combination of resource constraint and adaptive coupling in a Kuramoto network oscillator model can reliably generate seizure-like synchronization activity across different network topologies, including a biologically derived mesoscale mouse brain network. The model, coupled with a novel algorithm for tracking seizure propagation, provides mechanistic insight into the dynamics of transition to the synchronized state and its dependence on resources; and identifies key brain areas that may be involved in the initiation and spatial propagation of the seizure. The model, though minimal, efficiently recapitulates several experimental and theoretical predictions from more complex models and makes novel experimentally testable predictions.}

We conducted a comprehensive preoperative diagnostic work-up, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT), video-electroencephalogram (video-EEG), and clinical semiology. We then stratified 76 patients into three groups - low, moderate, and high focality - based on the focality of the seizure-onset zone. Such stratification was made to check the scoring ability in predicting VNS therapy seizure reduction. Our findings demonstrate an association between the extent of focality at the seizure-onset zone and the effectiveness of VNS, which may help to define the role of the 5-SENSE score in patient selection for VNS. This high dispersion of responses in the group with high focality reinforces the idea that outcome estimation is difficult and argues for an individualized strategy in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. A study at the level of the 5-SENSE score indicates the importance of detailed preoperative assessments that may better optimize selection for VNS therapy and further improve clinical outcomes.}

As a fundamental step towards addressing this gap, here we study predictive dynamical models of human intracranial EEG (iEEG) response under parametrically rich neurostimulation. Using data from n = 13 DRE patients, we find that stimulation-triggered switched-linear models with ~300 ms of causal historical dependence best explain evoked iEEG dynamics. These models are highly consistent across different stimulation amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for learning a generalizable model from abundant STIM OFF and limited STIM ON data. Further, evoked iEEG in nearly all subjects exhibited a distance-dependent pattern, whereby stimulation directly impacts the actuation site and nearby regions (≲ 20 mm), affects medium-distance regions (20 ~ 100 mm) through network interactions, and hardly reaches more distal areas (≳ 100 mm). Peak network interaction occurs at 60 ~ 80 mm from the stimulation site. Due to their predictive accuracy and mechanistic interpretability, these models hold significant potential for model-based seizure forecasting and closed-loop neurostimulation design.}
